# windowcaster v0.25-dev
Open-source port of Shadowcaster (1993, Raven Software) to modern Windows.

Designed to compile and run with GameMaker: Studio 1.4.1804. It should work on 1.4.9999 or 2.x, just not tested.

If you do not have GMS, you can start exploring by looking in WindowCaster.project.gmx. The program begins execution in objects/__EngineManager.object.gmx.

Note that currently, the source contains several copyrighted images and audio by Raven Software (but you still need a legitimate copy of the game to run this program). I will continue to work to remove these and depend entirely on the official game data as soon as I am able.
